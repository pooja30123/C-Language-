# 🧑‍💻 C Language Practice Codes

Welcome to my **C Language Practice** repository!  
This repo contains a broad collection of C programs I wrote to practice **core C concepts**, **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **basic file handling**.  
Each program is organized into directories based on its topic or purpose.
